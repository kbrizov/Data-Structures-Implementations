# Data-Structures-Implementations
These are basic data structures, written in C# by me, that every programmer should know. Writing them was a really valuable excersise for me back when I was first learning data structures years ago and they serve as good reference point to me to this day. That is the reason I decided to upload them here. These implementations are not the most optimal in terms of performance, but they underline the ideas of the abstract data structures and the algorithms applied to them. That being said and considering they are from my early days as a programmer, some of them surely can use some refactoring. Like I have mentioned in some of my other repositories, I have tried to follow best coding practices ever since I started programming. That means that despite being old, I found my implementations satisfactory enough to be uploaded publicly here so that they may serve as reference point to others as well.
