# Data-Structures-Implementations
These are data structures implemented writen in C# by me. These are basic data structures every programmer should know. Writing them was a really valuable excersise for me. Some of the implementations contain algorithms applied to the specific data structure. For example, the tree and graph implementations contain methods for traversals, pathfinding etc. These implementations are not the most optimal in terms of performance, but they underline the ideas of the abstract structures and they mostly serve as reference points for me. Also some of the implementations are older than others. That means that the old ones could probably use some refactoring, but it is unknown when it will happen or if it will happen at all.
